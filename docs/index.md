What does it mean to prioritize equity in policy? How can equity be operationalized across all stages of the policy process -- problem identification and policy formulation, policy analysis, and policy design and implementation? How would we go about understanding the way current policies or proposals support or hide inequitable processes and outcomes or the way policy design and implementation choices affect the experience of policy on the ground? These are the questions that will shape our work.

We will consider each of these key stages - formulation, analysis, and implementation -- in turn, (1) examining multiple policy frameworks, current ways we think about policy and the policy process, and asking where an equity lens could be usefully incorporated in policy formulation; (2) working through the classic steps in policy analysis to examine how equity could be centered in each when evaluating alternatives; and (3) looking at policy design choices to understand their impacts. By and large, equity is not a key concern in theories of the policy process, policy analysis, or implementation. There is no ready guidebook for how to understand what an equitable policy process or policy choices or policy designs look like. We will work together over the course of the semester to imagine where questions of equity fit, how to evaluate the equity of current practice and policies, and what changes would be required to fully engage that evaluation.
