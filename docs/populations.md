## Centering people

Policies are, at least part, oriented toward solving the problems people are facing or in creating conditions for people to thrive. Our applied work will center people. Each team will focus on a particular population for which you will identify a primary problem or need which might be (or is being) addressed through public policy. You’ll deepen and develop your understanding and evaluation through a series of memos.

### Potential Populations

We will identify teams on Monday, 8/30. Your team may choose one of the following populations or propose an alternative population. Either way, your team will identify your proposed choice by Wednesday, 9/1, on a shared google doc.

* Women in the military
* Migrants on the southern border
* Coastal populations
* Displaced workers
* Formerly incarcerated people
* Afghans seeking refuge
* Transgender youth
* Residents of drought- or heat-impacted places
* Unhoused persons
* People earning less than 30% of AMI
* Returning veterans
* Victims of human trafficking
* Frontline workers
* Pregnant woman/women with young children
* Native Americans on reservations

### Pre-memo Sketches

The first three exercises will be completed individually. In the pre-memo sketches, you’ll begin to

1. Problem identification: Articulate a central challenge, condition, or problem experienced by your selected population (Monday, 9/6);
2. Causes and Consequences: Outline the likely causes or contributors to the problem and consequences of the status quo for the population of interest (Monday, 9/13);
3. Policy Stakeholders: identify relevant stakeholders within the policy and problem domain (e.g., advocacy coalitions), including how each is socially constructed (e.g., Ingram and Schneider) (Monday, 9/20);

These should be no more than 750 words and will be submitted on our course collab file drop.

### Team Memos

(To be expanded)

In the first team memo, you’ll integrate your individual pre-memo sketch work, selecting, revising, and narrowing to address the above points and then working together to suggest alternative problem frames to the one you are using (e.g., Bacchi) and to identify additional stakeholders who should be part of problem solving.
