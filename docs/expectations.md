## Goals

Over the course of the semester, we will begin to develop a roadmap for equitable policy evaluation -- in policy process and formulation, policy analysis, and policy implementation. Through team-based projects focusing on different policies, we'll generate concrete examples of what such an evaluative process could look like across domains.

## Expectations and Evaluations
Grades will depend on your learning and contribution to this collective effort, which will be assessed by

### Individual Assignments (50%):

* Reading annotations and contributions (20%): To facilitate understanding and discussion we’ll all contribute to collaborative annotations and commenting of the reading using Perusall. I will review these ahead of class to help organize our discussion.

We have reading assigned on seventeen out of twenty-eight days (excluding 8/25 and 12/1). Contributing annotations to readings for at least *twelve* days is necessary for full credit. Make at least *four* full contributions for a given day’s reading.

A full contribution will go beyond agreeing with a point or asking a question. It will engage a point, connect it to other ideas we might learn from, amend it to suggest a more limited or wider scope, note conditions under which it is more or press relevant, ponder how it might inform your project or other work of which you are aware, ask a question and provide an initial answer. If others have already commented on a passage and you want to address and elaborate on the initial comment (beyond basic agreement), that’s good too. Think about the kinds of things you might raise in a discussion and bring them up in the annotations. You get the idea.

* Class contributions and participation (15%): Come prepared, do the reading, ask questions, chime in with ideas, help develop solutions. After each class, you’ll evaluate your own contributions for the day on a scale from 1 to 3 with a brief (e.g., one sentence) explanation:

1. I attended, but my head wasn’t in it or I didn’t prepare and didn’t speak.
2. I offered some comments and stayed engaged, but I know I could do more.
3. I was fully prepared and engaged and contributed ideas that transformed the way others understood the material or moved our collective learning forward.

* Memo Sketch Work (15%): Before the first group memo, you’ll submit three short pieces (i.e., 750 words max) demonstrating your independent thinking and work
